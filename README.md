# COMSATS Result Fetcher

At my university, we are eagerly waiting for the result of the final semester. But we dont know what the schedule for the result. We have to enter our
roll number , password, enter some captcha (dont know whats the need of the captcha on a student portal) and then login into the system, navigates
to some directories to see the result and mostly disappoint beecause result not announced yet.

So as a computer science student its my duty to solve that issue. Here I wrote a python script that will autmatically puts the login information
, solve the captcha and then navigates to a result directory and checks whether result is announced or not in a fraction of a second.
